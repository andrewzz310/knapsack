We propose an optimization for the original 0-1 knapsack problem using a modification of a genetic algorithm(GA) based on stopping criteria’s (convergence), mutations, generations, and cross-over parameters. 
To solve every subset of the knapsack problem and get the exact answer is a NP-complete task. 
However, we are seeking to optimize performance as well as latency and thus the exact answer may not always be provided but rather one as close as possible to the exact solution given the NP-context of the problem. 
We compared the latency and accuracy of our modified GA with an unoptimized GA version as well as Google’s dynamic programming knapsack solver (DPKS) and our own brute force implementation.
